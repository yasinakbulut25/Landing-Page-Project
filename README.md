#  Landing Page Project at Jotform

I coded the landing page project, my first internship project at Jotform, which I started as a UI Developer intern.

I did not use any ready-made CSS library such as bootstrap while coding the design. I coded the design to be responsive.

The full page printout of the design is as in the image below.
